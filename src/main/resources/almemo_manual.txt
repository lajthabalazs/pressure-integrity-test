Almemo (Ahlborn) device commands
================================

This document describes the Almemo commands supported for device selection, configuration,
measurements, and cycle control. Parameters are sent as specified (e.g. two-digit strings
without separating characters where noted).


Device selection
----------------

G<nn>   Select device
        Parameter: string in the form of two numeric digits, e.g. 00, 01, 15.
        The parameter must be sent without any separating characters.
        Examples: G00, G01, G15, G99.


Overview and configuration
--------------------------

P15     Fetch an overview of the entire setting of the device and the connected sensors.

P19     Fetch an overview of the current device configuration, settings and output modules.


Date and time
-------------

P13     Fetch date.

P10     Fetch time.

P46     Fetch measurement time.


Measuring point selection
-------------------------

M<nn>   Select measuring point.
        Parameter: two-character string that represents a number, e.g. M00, M01, M95.
        Same format as device selection (two digits, no separator).
        Examples: M00, M01, M95.


Measured values (for selected measuring point)
----------------------------------------------

P01     Outputs measured value for the selected measuring point.

P02     Outputs max value for the selected measuring point.

P03     Outputs min value for the selected measuring point.

P18     Outputs measured value list (last, min, max, average, ...).


Cycle control
-------------

S1      Outputs all measurements in a cycle.

S2      Start cycle without output of the header.

S3      Start cycle with output of the header.

X       Stop cycle.
